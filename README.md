#Workbench Window Utilities

This is a simple Eclipse plug-in that provides some sort of handy functionality for the workbench window
born out of the desire to be able to take consistently-szed screen shots.

Functionality includes:

* Hit ctrl+F12 to set the workbench window size to 1024x768; and
* Hit ctrl+shift+F12 to take a screen sot (after a five second delay)

##Installation

Install from source. Requires the use of the Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment (PDE).

* Load the source into your workspace;
* Build the site; and
* Use the p2 installer to install from that site.

At some point, we'll put this on bintray or something.

##Support

There is none. Open an issue and we'll try to help where we can.

Note that this not an official Eclipse plug-in produced by an Eclipse open source project.
